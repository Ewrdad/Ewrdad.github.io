# Edwards (ewrdad) Portfolio site

Just a simple site to act as a live CV and a bit of a playground

## FAQ

### Can I borrow code?
Feel free to , although this isnt the best code I can do and make sure you aren't pretending to be me.

### Why no tests?
This website has no advanced logic currently so tests arent fully required, and it'll speed me up adding stuff. This may change with time

### What can I do with the shared resources?
Feel free to use them anywhere. They are there to spread knowledge and to help people learn about topics.
